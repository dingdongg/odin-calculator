# Online Calculator

## Description

As the name of the project suggests, this is an online calculator website. You can create 
mathematical expressions and evaluate them by interacting with the GUI. This calculator
handles number overflow on the calculator's screen, as well as zero division errors.

## Link to website

To be added soon.

## Future ideas

There's a couple of things that I want to edit:
- Documenting my functions 
- Implementing keyboard support (not just mouse)

This project was made as part of [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator).
